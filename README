ORB DOCK - ORB NFC READER, NEOPIXEL RING CONTROL AND COMMUNICATION WITH EXTERNAL MICROCONTROLLERS VIA USB

For orb and dock details, see https://docs.google.com/document/d/15TdBDqpzjQM84aWcbPIud8OpBZvtFHylhdnx2yqqLoc

TROUBLESHOOTING:
 - Bootloader on some Arduinos is old - try switching the upload_speed in platformio.ini to 57600
 - remember to set the switches on the PN532 to the "SPI" position - left/1 down, right/2 up
 - remember to set Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor baud rate to 115200
 - Some docks use an old pinout - switch to the old PN532 pins in OrbDock.h

See OrbDockBasic for a simple example of how to implement an orb dock for your station.
To set your orb station, add it to main.cpp.

PIN CONNECTIONS 

PN532 RFID READER: 
  - ARDUINO NANO/UNO:
    - 5V -> 5V
    - GND -> GND
    - SCK  -> Digital 2
    - MISO -> Digital 3
    - MOSI -> Digital 4
    - SS   -> Digital 5
  
NEOPIXEL RING:
 - Data out -> Digital 6

STATIONS
Can store information for up to 16 stations. (NOTE: May change this to 10 so we only need 1 page per station)
For each station: Visited yes/no, and Energy 0-255
  0 - Control console - CONSOLE
  1 - Thought Distiller - DISTILLER
  2 - Casino - CASINO
  3 - Forest - FOREST
  4 - Alchemization Station - ALCHEMY
  5 - Pipes - PIPES
  6 - Init/reset station

TODO:
- Communicate with external microcontroller
- Slerp comms
- Allow gambling in Casino with all energy, not just station's energy
- Jungle station
- Alchemization station
- Thought distiller station
- Control console station
- Retoxify station
